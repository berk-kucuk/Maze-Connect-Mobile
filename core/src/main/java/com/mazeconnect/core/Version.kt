/**
 * Wire protocol version. Bumped on breaking changes to framing or to the
 * message set; must stay in lock-step with the desktop client's
 * `mazeconnect::core::kProtocolVersion`.
 *
 * v2 replaced the KDE-Connect-style capabilities (clipboard, notifications,
 * ping) with the Maze management ones. A v1 peer has nothing useful to say to
 * a v2 peer, and the version check refuses the link outright rather than
 * negotiating down.
 *
 * v4 added the pairing commitment round: PairRequest now carries commit(nonce)
 * and a third message, PairReveal, opens it. A v3 peer sends its nonce in the
 * clear in PairRequest, which is what let a man-in-the-middle grind its own
 * nonce until both screens showed the same code (see Sas). Refusing the link is
 * the point: negotiating down to v3 would restore the very weakness, so an old
 * peer must be updated rather than accommodated.
